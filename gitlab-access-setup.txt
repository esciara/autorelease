To run the functional (BDD) tests (through running ``tox -e bdd`` or ``behave``),
proper credentials for using git and for using the GitLab API must be present on
your system.

PREREQUISITE

You must first create an access token on your GitLab instance (See
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html for
instructions). You might or might not want to give full access to the token
(I did and have not looked at what is the minimal requirement).

CREDENTIALS FOR GIT

Please refer to https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage
for more info. The approach we used is the following:

- use the 'store' mode by running the command line:
```
$ git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ~/.git-credentials'
```
- update your `~/.git-credentials` with: `https://username:access_token@your.gitlab-server.com`

CREDENTIALS FOR GITLAB API

Credentials must be written in the `secrets/gitlab-python.cfg`, which has
been added to the `.gitignore` file (so it is excluded from the repo).
Please refer to https://python-gitlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html#content ,
which details the content needed in this file. In our setup, the server declared
as ``default`` will be used.
