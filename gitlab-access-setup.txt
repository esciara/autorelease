INTRODUCTION: BDD TESTS INTERACT WITH GITLAB

To run the functional (BDD) tests (through running ``tox -e bdd`` or ``behave``),
proper credentials for using Git (for push/pull) and for using the GitLab API
(for creating/update GitLab projects) must be present on your system.


PREREQUISITE: GITLAB ACCESS TOKEN

You must first create an access token on your GitLab instance (See
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html for
instructions).

You might or might not want to give full access to the token
(I did and have not looked at what are the minimal requirements).


GIVING CREDENTIALS TO GIT

Please refer to https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage
for more info. We used the following approach:

- use the 'store' mode by running the command line:
```
$ git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ~/.git-credentials'
```

- update your ``~/.git-credentials` with: ``https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN@your.gitlab-server.com``


GIVING CREDENTIALS TO THE PYTHON GITLAB API CLIENT

Please refer to https://python-gitlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html#content
for more info. We used the following approach:

- Credentials must be written in the ``secrets/gitlab-python.cfg`` file (which has
been added to the ``.gitignore`` file so it is excluded from the repo).

- The server used is the one declared as ``default``.

- Here is an example of ``secrets/gitlab-python.cfg`` file:
```
[global]
default = your_gitlab_server
ssl_verify = true
timeout = 5

[your_gitlab_server]
url = https://your.gitlab-server.com
private_token = YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
